# Song Request

This repository contains The Tenants song request system. This is a Flutter project hosted in Firebase, with a Firestore database. People can visit the website (via QR code on our flyer), see the songs, and request them. We have a different view that shows us what songs have been requested, and how many times, so we can see what's popular.

The crowd view is hosted at: https://tenants-rule.web.app/
